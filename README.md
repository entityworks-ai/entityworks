# EntityWorks

EntityWorks is an independent standards and research organisation focused on how AI systems form, stabilise, and act on representations of people, organisations, relationships, and ideas.

Its work sits at the intersection of AI interpretation, structural risk, and machine-mediated decision-making, with an emphasis on long-horizon effects that are not visible through optimisation or performance metrics alone.

This repository exists as a public reference surface for selected materials and artefacts.
